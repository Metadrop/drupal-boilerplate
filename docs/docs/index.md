# Default home documentation home page

Welcome to the project's documentation!

!!!NOTE
    This is the default home page of a project created using [Metadrops's boilerplate](https://github.com/Metadrop/drupal-boilerplate). Please, make any changes so your project is well documented. This documentation provides a skeleton structure that you follow or revamp as you wish. Also, there are some pages about the [boilerplate](boilerplate/index.md) itself, you may want to check them if your new to this project or this boilerplate.

    ## First steps

    You probably want to complete the [onboarding](onboarding/about.md) section to anyone coming to this project has all the onboarding information, specially the [local environment setup page](onboarding/local.md).

    Once your project has different environments available you may configure the [Drush aliases](boilerplate/drush.md#drush-preconfiguration) so anyone working in the project can easily access them.
