# Project design and structure

!!! NOTE
    This is the default page for the project's design and structure. Please, complete with your project's information.

    Proposed sections:

    - General overview
    - Components (Using Solr? Is it a headless project with an Angular front-end?
    - Entities
    - Roles
    - Notes on contrib code used
    - Custom modules
    - Custom themes
    - Sites (for multisite projects)
    - Configuration comments (Configuration splits purposes and other useful information)
    - External processes (for example, needed cron jobs or any other process needed by the project to run properly)

    If the information is simple you can just add it here, or create new pages for each section if you want to organize separately.
