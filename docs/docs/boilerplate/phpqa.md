# Phpqa

[Phpqa](https://github.com/EdgedesignCZ/phpqa)  is a code analysis tool that relies on other tools like phppcd, phpcs or phpmd.

Very handy to get the trend of code evolution in your project.

If you want use the static analysis tools manually or you need to add it to your continuous integration system there is a phpqa configuration for it.

To run it, just run:

```
docker-compose exec php phpqa
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done in the `.phpqa.yml` file. Check [phpqa configuration section](https://github.com/EdgedesignCZ/phpqa#advanced-configuration---phpqayml) for geting help.

By default, phpqa analyzes custom code folders (`web/modules/custom` and `web/themes/custom`). Reports are configured to be written in `reports/codereview` but they are not generated by default.
