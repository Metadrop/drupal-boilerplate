# Folder structure


The folder structure scaffold is based on [drupal/recommended-project](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project), the Drupal's [official recommended method to install Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#download-core). This way, all your dependencies are managed by Composer, Drupal is required as [drupal/core-recommended](https://github.com/drupal/core-recommended) package and web-root files are automatically generated via [drupal/core-composer-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal/core-composer-scaffold) Composer plugin.


The codebase is located, as usual, in the  `web` folder. A default site is configured in `web/sites/default`.

The project uses the following folders:


  - `backups/`: default folder to export backups (using [Scripthor's backup script](https://github.com/Metadrop/scripthor/blob/fb-backup-script/README.md#backup-sh)).
  - `config/`: folder to store the Drupal configuration files. Configuration export and import is done from/to this folder.
    - `default/`: global configuration (all environments, and all sites if this is a multisite project).
    - `envs/`: per environment configuration. The [Configuration Split module](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_split) needs to be configured to use these folders.
        - `local/`: local environment configuration.
        - `dev/`: development environment configuration.
        - ...
    - `site/`: per site configuration for multisite setups. You can add per site and per env configuration if needed. The [Configuration Split module](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_split) needs to be configured to use these folders.
        - `site1/`
            - `envs/`
                - `local/`
                - `prod/`
