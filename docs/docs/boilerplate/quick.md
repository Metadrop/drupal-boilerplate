## How to configure the project

Select `yes` when asked to run the configuration wizard during the boilerplate installation process (this is when running the `composer create-project` command).

If you didn't select `yes` during the boilarplate installation you can run it once installed using `composer`:

`composer scripthor:assistant`


!!! warning
    This command will overwrite any configuration you have done on the files it handles.


Or you can use the `make setup` command. This commands prepares de containers, does a minimal configuration, installs composer packages and tries to reload the local environment with data from a remote environment.


## How to manage containers

You can use `docker-compose`as you usually would do. However, there are some `make` commands to easily perform some common actions:

- Bring containers up to work on the project:

  `make` or `make up`

  Both run the same actions.

- Stop containers:

  `make stop` or `make down`

- Remove all containers:

  `make prune`

## Get a shell inside a container

`make shell` for a shell inside the PHP container.

`make shell <CONTAINER NAME>` for a shel in antoher container.


## Run a drush command on the PHP container

`make drush <command>` to run a Drush command.

## Access the MaraiDB database CLI as root

First, connect to the database container:

`make shell mariadb`

Once inside the MariaDB database container run:

`mysql -u root -ppassword -b drupal`

If have changed the default values you will have to update in the command. Checl your `.env` file for the current values.

## Reload project with data from a remote environment


You can use the Scripthor script to reload the data:

`scripts/reload-local.sh --site=<SITE_ALIAS>`
