### Scripthor toolset

[Scripthor](https://github.com/Metadrop/scripthor) is our set of scripts for our daily routine, to speed up the development workflow.

Til today, we provide the following scripts:
- **reload-local.sh**: Reload your local environment setting everything up for a new developer, a new branch, or just
  to ensure your changes won't break production during the deployment.
- **frontend-build.sh**: Compile your sass and js-es6 files inside docker so you don't need to have node or gulp
  installed on your machine. Forget about version issues.
- **copy-content-config-entity-to-module.sh**: For a given content entity (content type, paragraph, custom block type...)
  it will take the entity definition, all its fields, form configuration and view modes and will copy them to the module of
  your choice.
- **backup.sh**: Perform a full backup of the site, db and files.
- **setup-traefik-port.sh** Get the port generated by traefik and bulk it on .env.
- **update-helper.sh** Allows to update and commit drupal modules and dependencies.
- **solr-sync.sh** Reload docker Solr cores from local files.
